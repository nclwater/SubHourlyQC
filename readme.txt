Sub-hourly QC of rainfall data
Step 1. 
	Run a frequency and resolution check to ensure that the data subject to SHQC is of the requisite resolution. 
	In our original implementation we filter out data which has reporting frequencies greater than or equal to
	30 minutes. We also remove data with integer resolution, usually indicating errors in data processing as tips 
	which were not converted to rainfall depths. 
	
Step 2. 
	Run the threshold based SHQC. Thresholds may be defined by the user for hourly, 15-minute, and 1-minute aggregations.
	Thresholds may also vary for each month. 
	
Log files are generated by both functions. 
Input data should consist, at the minimum, of a sub-hourly rainfall timeseries. 
User defined parameters include the monthly thresholds which are provided as function inputs. 
Currently hard-coded parameters include the frequency and resolution checks, these can be easily modified. 

The functions have been coded with parallelisation in mind, and can be applied to a series of individual gauge files using joblib's Parallel.
